## Learning jQuery 

You will have to make a mini Car racing game. The pictures (or the gifs) which
you are going to use for this challenge are sent & they are in the ‘img’ folder. You will have the
starter files, so use those, instead of making new ones.  
The game design should be exactly the same as it is shown in the video.  
On the top of the page, there should be 2 buttons. When you click the first one ‘Race!’ the
game starts. When you click the ‘Start over’ button the game resets, if it’s finished (meaning: 
the cars go at the starting positions).  
The game starts with a countdown, which you will have to create (& is centered relatively to
the ‘racetrack’). When the countdown reaches 0, it just disappears and the cars start to race.
The cars must go to the very end of the ‘racetrack’ and stop there (they should not continue
outside of the window). When one of the cars reaches the end, the ‘racetrack’ gets darken
and a finish flag appears with an animation on top of the ‘racetrack’.  
Also, while the race is in progress, the buttons on top should be disabled and you cannot
click on any of the buttons until the race finishes. When the race is over, they can be
clickable again.  
The bottom section of the page, below the ‘racetrack’ should display results for every race.  
On the left side, the results must be placed in a table with the correct timing (in milliseconds) 
and the correct place a car has achieved in the given race. On every new race, a new results
should be inserted in a new row.  
The right side of the page should be empty at first (if you start the game for the very first time)
and nothing should show up there. When you play the game for at least 1 time, and you
refresh the page, the bottom right side of the page should show up the: ‘Results from the
previous time you played this game:’, also in a table. These results should be correct as well
(obviously) and should show up the results of the last game that you played before refreshing
the page (hint: localstorage).  
**Note: the game design should be made exactly the same as given in the video.  
**Note: the page can be responsive (for tablets at the most)  


Scoring :  
● 1 point for making the design exactly the same like shown in the video. (no excuses
this time, if you are not certain about anything - ASK) & make the cars race when you click
the ‘Race!’ button.  
● 3 points if you make the game reset on the ‘Start over’ button & populate the table
on the bottom left with correct info about every race (like shown in the video). Also make
the buttons disabled when the race is in progress.  
● 5 points if you show the countdown on every start of a new race, show the finish flag at 
the end of every race, and populate the table on the bottom right with info about the last
race on the last time you played this game.
